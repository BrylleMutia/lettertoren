      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        <br />
        <p>To my dearest Ren,</p>
        <br />
        <p>I hope you're doing well.</p>
        <p>I just felt like writing the things I never get to tell you.</p>
        <p>Within this very short span of time that I've been with you, I feel like I already found someone I could rely upon.</p>
        <p>So, I just wanted to tell you that I'll always be here for you, to listen to your stories, chika, rants, and even the most random bullshit you'll throw at me.</p>
        <p>I may not know where we're heading from here, but I just hope that you'll never get tired of me, because I will never get tired of you.</p>
        <p>It's surreal how sometimes even the smallest things remind me of you, and I just smile for no reason at all.</p>
        <p>
          I love everything about you. <br />I love how you talk about your snacks. <br />I love how you talk about your hobbies. <br />I love how you tell your stories. <br />I love how you rock those black outfits. <br />I love how you laugh at my
          silly jokes. <br />And I love having conversations with you, even the most nonsense ones.
        </p>
        <p>I love you more than anything, and I hope you have a birthday that's as amazing as you are.</p>
        <br />
        <p>All my love, <br />Brylle. <3</p>
